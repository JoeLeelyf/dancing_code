    "torch.nn is a subpackage in the PyTorch library that provides various classes and functions for building and training neural networks. It stands for \"neural networks\" and is a fundamental component of PyTorch for developing deep learning models. <br>\n",
    "The torch.nn package provides a high-level API for defining and organizing neural networks, including layers, activation functions, loss functions, optimizers, and more. It allows you to design and train neural networks using an object-oriented approach. <br>\n",
    "Here are some key components and functionalities provided by the torch.nn package:\n",
    "- Neural Network Layers: torch.nn provides a wide range of pre-defined layers such as linear (fully connected), convolutional, recurrent, pooling, normalization, and activation layers. These layers can be easily combined to create complex network architectures.\n",
    "- Activation Functions: torch.nn includes popular activation functions like ReLU, sigmoid, tanh, and more. These functions introduce non-linearity to the network, enabling it to learn complex patterns and make predictions.\n",
    "- Loss Functions: torch.nn provides a variety of loss functions such as mean squared error (MSE), cross-entropy, binary cross-entropy, and more. These functions quantify the difference between the predicted output of the network and the true target values, serving as a measure of the network's performance.\n",
    "- Optimizers: torch.nn supports various optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and more. These optimizers update the network's parameters based on the computed gradients during the training process, aiming to minimize the loss function.\n",
    "- Custom Networks: torch.nn allows you to define custom neural network architectures by subclassing the torch.nn.Module class. This class provides the necessary functionality to define the forward pass of the network and automatically tracks the network's parameters.\n",
    "- Data Handling: torch.nn provides classes and utilities for handling input data transformations, batching, shuffling, and more, making it easier to preprocess and feed data to the network."

    "## Recurrent Layers\n",
    "Recurrent layers, also known as recurrent neural network (RNN) layers, are a type of layer commonly used in neural networks for processing sequential data. Unlike feedforward neural networks that process inputs independently, recurrent layers have connections that allow information to persist across different time steps.<br>\n",
    "The key feature of recurrent layers is their ability to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in sequential data. They achieve this by maintaining an internal hidden state that is updated at each time step and serves as a form of memory. This hidden state is shared across all time steps, allowing the network to learn and remember information from previous time steps.<br>\n",
    "Recurrent layers can be used in various applications where the input data has a temporal or sequential nature, such as natural language processing, speech recognition, time series analysis, and handwriting recognition."

    "- num_layers – Number of recurrent layers. E.g., setting num_layers=2 would mean stacking two RNNs together to form a stacked RNN, with the second RNN taking in outputs of the first RNN and computing the final results. Default: 1\n",
    "- nonelinearity – The non-linearity to use. Can be either ‘tanh’ or ‘relu’. Default: ‘tanh’\n",
    "- bias – If False, then the layer does not use bias weights b_ih and b_hh. Default: True\n",
    "- batch_first – If True, then the input and output tensors are provided as (batch, seq, feature). Default: False\n",
    "- dropout – If non-zero, introduces a Dropout layer on the outputs of each RNN layer except the last layer, with dropout probability equal to dropout. Default: 0"
