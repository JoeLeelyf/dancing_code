# Dancing Code 

## 0. Introduction

This repo is aimed to record the process of learning CS. It's based on the following  shared beliefs:

- **Useful Recording**: Recording while learning
- **Improve Efficiency Through Sharing**: Similar issues, shared benefits 
- **Communicating More**: Make more firends, absorb more information



## 1. Architecture

The repo is aimed to both document your own learning process and share your knowledge with each one. Git's branch character can help us make a balance between these:

- **Main Branch**: A demo of the directory structure

  ```txt
  . # root dir
  ├── AI	# First-level dir, different areas of CS
  │   ├── CV	# Sub-topic of this area
  │   ├── MultiModal
  │   └── NLP
  ├── Back End
  ├── Front End
  ├── Others
  │   ├── Laguage Learning
  │   │   ├── C++
  │   │   ├── Java
  │   │   └── Python
  │   └── Useful Tools
  │       ├── CLI
  │       └── Git
  └── README.md
  ```

  

- **Your Own Branch**: Create your own branch, where you can DIY your directory  structure and write down anything about your learning! But to conveniently merge your branch to the main branch, you're suggested to alignment with the main branch's structure mentioned above.

- **Several Suggestion**:
  - **Follow the dir architecture**
  - **Normalized pipeline**:
    - Use markdown file (.md) as the only document form. Especially for python learning, Jupter Notebook (.ipynb) is recommended.
    - Demonstrate how to run your code. For example, add a requirements.txt file to your python project to assist  both yourself and others in annoying env configuration. When necessary, add a README.md file to your sub-dir.



## 2. Contribute

After getting familiar with the structure of this project, anyone is welcomed and can feel free to contribute to the building of it, which means you can clone this repo to your disk, creat your own branch and start recording your CS journey! Also, make pull requests to the main branch when you want to share with others, and feel free to make an issue when you have doubts about other people's codes or opinions !
